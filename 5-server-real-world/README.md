# Server Real World

This is a real-world server project built with Node.js, Express, and various other libraries. It showcases the evolution of a server from basic to advanced, with modularization, SOLID principles, and additional features.

## Getting Started

To get started with the server, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up the environment variables by creating a `.env` file and adding the necessary variables.
4. Start the server: `npm start`

  - `app.js`: The entry point of the server. It sets up the Express server and integrates the routes, controllers, services, middlewares, and utilities.
  - `routes`: This directory contains the route definitions for the server.
    - `index.js`: This file exports a function that sets up the routes for the server.
  - `controllers`: This directory contains the controller logic for each route.
    - `index.js`: This file exports controller classes that handle the logic for each route.
  - `services`: This directory contains the service logic for each route.
    - `index.js`: This file exports service classes that encapsulate the business logic for each route.
  - `middlewares`: This directory contains the middleware functions used in the server's request/response pipeline.
    - `index.js`: This file exports middleware functions that can be used in the server's request/response pipeline.
  - `utils`: This directory contains utility functions that can be used throughout the server.
    - `index.js`: This file exports utility functions that can be used throughout the server.
  - `tests`: This directory contains tests for the server's functionality.
    - `index.js`: This file contains tests for the server's functionality.
- `package.json`: This file is the configuration file for npm. It lists the dependencies and scripts for the server.
- `.env`: This file contains environment variables used in the server.
- `.gitignore`: This file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git.
- `Dockerfile`: This file contains instructions for building a Docker image of the server.
