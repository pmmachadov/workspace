# Server Solid

This is a server built with Node.js, Express, and SOLID principles. It provides a solid foundation for building scalable and maintainable web applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with the server, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/server-solid.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the server: `npm start`

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

```
├── src
│   ├── app.js
│   ├── routes
│   │   └── index.js
│   ├── controllers
│   │   └── index.js
│   └── services
│       └── index.js
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

- `src/app.js`: The entry point of the server. It sets up an Express server and configures the routes, controllers, and services.
- `src/routes/index.js`: Defines the routes for the server. It handles incoming requests and delegates the logic to the corresponding controller.
- `src/controllers/index.js`: Contains the controller classes that handle the business logic for each route.
- `src/services/index.js`: Contains the service classes that encapsulate the core functionality of the server.

## Features

- Modularized code structure for better organization and maintainability.
- Separation of concerns between routes, controllers, and services.
- SOLID principles for writing clean and extensible code.
- Easy to add new routes, controllers, and services.
