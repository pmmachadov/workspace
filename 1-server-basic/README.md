This is the basic server in the project. It sets up a simple Express server with a single route that returns a "Hello, World!" message. It uses Nodemon for automatic reloading during development. To get started, clone the repository and follow the instructions in the README.md file.

Next, I will generate the contents of the file `/workspace/2-server-modular/README.md`.
