# Server Advanced

This is an advanced server built with Node.js, Express, and various other libraries. It includes modularized routes, controllers, services, and middlewares to provide a scalable and maintainable server architecture.

## Getting Started

To get started with the server, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd 4-server-advanced`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the server: `npm start`

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

```
4-server-advanced

│   ├── app.js
│   ├── routes
│   │   └── index.js
│   ├── controllers
│   │   └── index.js
│   ├── services
│   │   └── index.js
│   └── middlewares

└── README.md
```

- `src/app.js`: The entry point of the server. It sets up an Express server and configures the routes, controllers, services, and middlewares.
- `src/routes/index.js`: Defines the routes for the server. Each route is associated with a controller function.
- `src/controllers/index.js`: Contains the controller functions that handle the logic for each route.
- `src/services/index.js`: Provides service functions that encapsulate the business logic for each route.
- `src/middlewares/index.js`: Contains middleware functions that can be used in the server's request/response pipeline.

## Dependencies

The server has the following dependencies:

- express: A fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- body-parser: Middleware for parsing request bodies.
- cors: Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).
- helmet: Middleware for securing HTTP headers.
- morgan: Middleware for logging HTTP requests.
- dotenv: Library for loading environment variables from a .env file.

## Scripts

The server provides the following scripts:

- `start`: Starts the server using nodemon for automatic restart on file changes.
- `test`: Runs the server's test suite.
